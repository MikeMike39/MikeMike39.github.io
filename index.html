          <h3>Birth</h3>
    
          <p>I was born on a Thursday in December in St Thomas hospital. With all teeth fingers an toes not that much sense.lol. 
              My mom fresh out of highschool with a new baby. I don't know what i would have done but somehow she did. Beyond anything
              I could have imagine. An d growing up on a island sounds cool until September when it hurricane season..
              I have been in several storms three of which took everything but the clothes on my back. Hugo an Marilyn üôÉ
               Fast forward Im the oldest of my moms kids which are spanned out across three decades 80's 90's 00's 
              babies lol. Its so cool having siblings a generation or two removed..Keeps you young....I think lol
          </p>
    
          <h3>Early Years</h3>
    
          <p>Where to start..I was bad.smh.Like i got expelled from school bad. More than once. I just remember coming home one day
              an my mom tell me I wss going to live with my aunt.who at the time was a drill sergeant at fort bragg..Needless to say 
              My aunt saved my life. An I will always love an appreciate her for what she did for me. The only benefit of being bad an living 
              with military person is i got to move.. a lot..so i lived in at least 8 states both coast of the us an still haven't been to beach
              an wont be going either.. God spoiled me if i cant see my toes i don't go into the waterüèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
