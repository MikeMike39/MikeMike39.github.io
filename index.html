          <p> I was born on a Thursday in December in St Thomas hospital. With all teeth fingers an toes not that much sense.lol. 
              My mom fresh out of highschool with a new baby. I don't know what i would have done but somehow she did; Beyond anything
              I could have imagine. An I know growing up on a island sounds cool..but wait until September when it hurricane season hits.
              I have been in several storms, three of which took everything but the clothes on my back. Hugo an Marilyn üôÉ to name two.
               Fast forward Im the oldest of my moms kids which are spanned out across three decades 80's 90's 00's babies lol. Its so cool
                having siblings a generation or two removed..Keeps you young....I think lol
          </p>
    
          <h3 style="font-size:2vw">Early Years</h3>

          <p> Where to start..I was bad.smh.Like i got expelled from school bad. More than once. I just remember coming home one day
              an my mom tell me I was going to live with my aunt. Who at the time was a Drill Sergeant at Fort Bragg..Needless to say 
              My aunt saved my life. An I will always love an appreciate her for what she did for me.An my mom for not being afraid to ask for help.
               The only benefit of being bad an living with military person is i got to move.. a lot..so i lived in at least 8 states both coast of
                the us an still haven't been to beach an wont be going either.. God spoiled me if i cant see my toes i don't go into the waterüèä‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

            <h3 style="font-size:2vw">Cooking...Really?</h3> 
    
          <p> Man this is like the story of Jesus in bible..So im 21 don't have a clue what or where i want to be or do. At the time I was living in Orlando
              and i saw a ad for a culinary school an i was like "I can do that"..And I did. I worked for Jacksonville Jaguars for the 06-07 NFL Season. First Job btw.
              I hated Jacksonville so I drove from Orlando everyday smh 100+miles.It was awesome the players had a nick name for me and everything lol. I Got tired of
               Florida...Go figure lol. An I move to west Hollywood Ca where i worked in Beverly hills an a few other places.no name dropping ..i can cook lol..But i was 
               facing the same problem many of my people face. I compare the culinary lifestyle to the nfl as there are many races of players but only one race in charge.
               So to see my hopes of being an Ex.Chef fade; i choose it all leave behind after 16yrs an pickup a keyboard..I found you can do more damage with ‚å®Ô∏è than a üî™

               <h3 style="font-size:2vw">So you think you can code?</h3>

            <p> God knows Im trying and I must say its one of the hardest most enjoyable things in life. I mean a lot of anger an a lot of joy.
                I mean the easies of things can bring you down, an those same simple things bring you up. The joy in having a piece of code the works is only a joy shared by new
                moms. Its the act of creation anyone can make life "Digitally of course". I don't know how many hours have passed only for my error to be a misspelled word or
                missing semi-colon. Im finding my chefs eye for detail is helping me a whole lot just in the proofreading an the way i look for errors an problem solve. At this
                point i don't know what the future has plan for me an i like it. I hope for many many years of life to continue this adventure in coding. Maybe one day I'll make a game.
                Yes this looks like a bootleg Craig's list add but its a start.
            </p>
